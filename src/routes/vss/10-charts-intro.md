# Charts Introduction

Over the previous chapters, we explored the wealth of functionality we get 'out-the-box' with Svelte. But to create truly mesmerizing visual stories, we need a trusty method for creating **beautiful data visualizations**.

In the following chapters, therefore, we focus on **data visualization** in Svelte. We start from the ground up, exploring two core concepts of dataviz on the web - **SVG** and **Canvas** - and specifically how to implement these in Svelte.

With this foundation, we then explore how to **build charts** with [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics/) - an open source graphics framework for Svelte. Layer Cake takes away most of the complexity of building charts with Svelte, which makes it a great stepping-stone for us on our learning experience.

With **Layer Cake** you can build a lot of great things. But if your requirements are truly unique, custom-built data visualizations that are going to win you awards, you need [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The learning curve for **D3** has historically been _steep_. In the final chapter of this section of the book, I argue that with Svelte, the impossible becomes very possible. I give you the tools (and code) to implement nearly all of the D3 API in Svelte.

There's lots to get through, so let's get started!
