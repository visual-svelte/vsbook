# 1 Introduction

In this first section, I try to answer as many of the questions you might have as possible. If you have more, feel free to message me on Twitter.

## how much does this book cost?

- pay what you can afford/ what you think it's worth model.
- in other words, it's free.

## why write this book.

- I believe the world needs more visual storytelling.
- The bar to creating these experiences has been historically very high. I want to lower it.

## why svelte?

- created by a visual storyteller, specifically for this task.
- simple to learn.
- it's used by all the top shops.

## who is this book for?

- people who want to create visual stories like the new york times or the pudding.
- it is also written specifically for people who don't have a software engineering background (i.e. most people in the visual storytelling/ data journalism space).
- people what want to learn svelte, but in an applied manner.

## pre-requisites

- an understanding of html and css
- a basic understanding of javascript (esp data types)
- you have been through the svelte tutorial

## what will I learn?

- a broad overview of svelte and how it can be used to create engaging visual stories.
- then we look at implementing common third-party libraries to create visual stories in Svelte. THis includes D3.js and layercake for charts and D3 and leaflet for maps.
- then we explore how implment common visual storytelling techniques in Svelte. Scrollytelling, other stuff.
- then, we look at creating visual stories that run seamlessly on mobile, cater for users with accessibility requirements.

## how will I learn?

- I recognise that different people learn in different ways, so I have presented each topic in at least two of the following ways: written theory, interactive explainer visuals, hands-on code examples and video explanations throughout the course. Audio-visual bombardment is my style of teaching.
- visual storytelling is awesome in that it touches on very left-brain and very right-brain skills. This can make it challenging, but also highly rewarding. I will focus on the hands-on, getting our hands dirty writing code side of visual storytelling, although I dedicate the first chapter to "all the other important stuff" like actual storytelling, design, and data handling.
- the code does not write itself and the stories don't write themselves,

## why svelte?

- svelte has recently become 1.0
- used by all the best data storytelling companies.
- learnability,

## why make it open source

- to get as many people to read it as possible,
- to get other contributors to share their experiences (correct my mistakes)
- to give back to the community which helped me learn.

## how do you recommend I study this material?

- completely up to you.
- use our study scheduler.
- each of the sections has been designed to last one hour, plus two hours of exercises to properly get a concept (as a guideline)
- use social-proof? .
