# {chapter} Charts Introduction

Over the previous chapters, we explored the wealth of functionality we get 'out-the-box' with Svelte. But to create truly mesmerizing visual stories, we need a trusty method for creating **beautiful data visualizations**.

We start by looking at how to **build charts** with [Layer Cake](https://layercake.graphics/) - an open source graphics framework for Svelte. Layer Cake takes away most of the complexity of building charts with Svelte, which makes it a great stepping-stone for us on our learning experience.

With **Layer Cake** you can build a lot of great things. But if your requirements are truly unique, custom-built data visualizations that are going to win you awards, you need [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The learning curve for **D3** has historically been _steep_. In the final chapter of this section of the book, I argue that with Svelte, the impossible becomes very possible. I give you the tools (and code) to implement nearly all of the D3 API in Svelte.

## {chapter}.1 SVG and Canvas

A really important part of building interactive data visualizations on the web is SVG and Canvas. They are both used in Layer Cake and D3, so it's a good idea to know what they are before we begin this section.

The Mozilla developer docs is a good place to brush up on your [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial) and [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) skills.

There's lots to get through, so let's get started!
