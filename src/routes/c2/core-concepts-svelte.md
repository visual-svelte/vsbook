# CORE CONCEPTS

[para intro] In this section, I want to introduce you to core concepts into WHAT Svelte is and how it works.

## Svelte is a compiler

Svelte is simply a compiler. It takes the code you right in your .svelte files and 'compiles' (or translates) what you've written into 'vanilla' Javascript. This javascript gets sent to our browser for execution. That's it.

Svelte's big strength is this simplicity.

- svelte is a compiler (and how this is different to other languages)
  - sveltekit ssr
  - hydration?
  - declaring stuff (let, const, $:, in onMount)
  - endpoints
