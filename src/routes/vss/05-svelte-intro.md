# SVELTE for Storytelling

Svelte comes with lots of functionality to help us create interactive stories.

In this section, I will briefly outline what Svelte is and how it can help us build visual stories.

In the rest of the mini-chapters in this section, I focus on specific packages that come out-the-box with Svelte.

Then, assuming you have worked your way through the [Svelte tutorials](https://svelte.dev/tutorial), I explain how we might apply them in the visual storytelling context.

## Svelte is a compiler

Svelte is simply a compiler. It takes the code you right in your .svelte files and 'compiles' (or translates) what you've written into 'vanilla' Javascript. This javascript gets sent to our browser for execution. That's it.

Svelte's big strength is this simplicity.
