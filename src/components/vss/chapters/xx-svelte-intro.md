# {chapter} Svelte for Storytelling

In this section, we will explore the functionality that Svelte gives us 'out-the-box', and how to use this functionality to build beautiful, interactive stories.

But before we get to the 'fun stuff', there is some background knowledge about how Svelte actually works, which I think is important to learn, at least at a basic level, if we want to build with Svelte. This is especially true if you come from a non-computer science background (like I did!).

So, let's dive in...

## {chapter}.1 Svelte is a compiler

Svelte is simply a compiler. It takes the code you right in your .svelte files and 'compiles' (or translates) what you've written into 'vanilla' Javascript. This javascript gets sent to our browser for execution. That's it.

Svelte's big strength is this simplicity.
